--- HOW TO START MINING ---
---------------------------

There is nothing more simple.
Just run the "xmrig" and let it turn.

You can open a terminal, reach the extracted directory like that : 
# cd /home/mynameorsomething/MyMinerDirectory/

then lanch it without any configuration :
# ./xmrig

... If there is a privilege problem :
# chmod +x xmrig

and then you should be able to execute it :
# ./xmrig

If you want to change any configuration check into config.json. (if you know how to do it...)

Happy mining !
